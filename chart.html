<p>Technetium (Tc 43):
    <br>
    Technetium is a radioactive, silver-grey transition metal. When introduced into the human body it penetrates almost all internal organs.
</p>

</p>
<p>Astatine (At 85)
    <br>
    Astatine is a radioactive halogen which is toxic and resembles iodine. Astanine is the rarest of all elements found in nature.
</p>
<p>Radon (Rn 86)
    <br>
    Radon is a radioactive noble gas that may present risks to health and life. Radon occurs in nature. It is used in agriculture to activate feed for domestic animals. If it is inhaled in a significant quantity, it can cause lung cancer.
</p>
<p>Francium (Fr 87)
    <br>
    Francium is a radioactive alkali metal, which has a high chemical activity. Francium has no practical application due to it's low half-life and high radiation emissions.
</p>
<p>Radium (Ra 88)
    <br>
    Radium is a shiny, silver-white alkaline-earth-metal that tarnishes quickly in air. Radium is rarely occuring in nature, but is extremely radiotoxic. If absorbed into the body, it is treated like calcium and subsequently accumulates in the bones. Large concentrations cause osteoporosis, sponteneous fractures, malignant bone tumours and hematoietic tissue.
</p>
<p>Actinium (Ac 89)
    <br>
    Actinium is a silver-what actinide metal. It glows neon blue in the dark due to it's high radioactivity. It is even more rare than Radium.
</p>
<p>Thorium (Th 90)
    <br>
    Thorium is an actinide named after the Norse god Thor. It is present in trace amounts deep in the earth and in seawater. It can be utilised in Thorium small module reactors; which are much safer, than conventional uranium fission reactors.
</p>
<p>Protactinium (Pa 91)
    <br>
    Protactinium is a light-grey actinide metal, it is a byproduct of Plutonium and is extremely toxic; regardless of it's high radioactivity.
</p>
<p>Uranium (U 92)
    <br>
    Uranium is a very heavy, silver-white glossy actinide metal. It is used to achieve fission in nuclear reactors, it's depleted forms are used for armour-peircing rounds and bunker-buster missiles.
</p>
<p>Neptunium (Np 93)
    <br>
    Neptunium is a malleable, soft actinide metal that shines like glitter. Neptunium does not occur in nature. It is used for the production of Plutonium.
</p>
<div class="pu94"></div>
<p>Plutonium (Pu 94)
    <br>
    Plutonium is a silver actinide metal that oxides very qucikly like nickel. Plutonium does not occur in nature and has no stable isotopes, it is also a high neutron and gamma emitter, making it extremely dangerous for any living beings to be in close proximity. It is used for nuclear warheads and fission reactors; although safer concepts for fission reactors not involving Plutonium have been devised and are feasible. it has no medical uses and if made obsolete in nuclear power; it would then serve no beneficial purpose for humanity. It's waste and byproducts have half-lives of tens of thousands of years making it an environmental hazard. If there's an element you can call anti-life, it's Plutonium. After world war 2; unethical researchers including the CIA; conducted experiments on animals and humans; where they administered plutonium into the test subjecs intravenously; they deduced that a lethal dose is only a few miligrams per kilogram of tissue. 
</p>
<p>Americium (Am 95)
    <br>
    Americium is a silver-white malleable actinide metal. It is a heavy alpha emitter, but all alphas also emit some gamma radiation too. Americium is used in old smoke alarms; once smoke fills the chamber, the element ionises the air to produce a current which sounds the alarm. It is generally toxic, regardless of radioactivity and has a half-life of 430+ years.
</p>
<p>Curium (Cm 96)
    <br>
    Curium is another trans-uranic, actinide metal named after Marie Curie. It is produced in nuclear fission reactors. It is a dangerous neutron emitter.
</p>
<p>Berkelium (Bk 97)
    <br>
    Berkeleium is another trans-uranic actinide metal that does not occur in nature. It is used for producing Californium isotopes.
</p>
<p>Californium (Cf 98)
    <br>
    Californium is an extremely reactive actinide metal as well as a very dangerous neutron emitter. It is used for neutron-activation studies and also in radiotherapy for tumours.
</p>
<p>Einsteinium (Es 99)
    <br>
    Einsteinium is a trans-uranic actinide metal that glows blue in the dark. It is used for the production of Mendelvium.
</p>
<p>Fermium (Fm 100)
    <br>
    Fermium is another trans-uranic actinide metal. Fermium was contained in the fallout of the first thermonuclear explosion in 1952. It only has a half-life of 20 hours.
</p>
<p>Mendelevium (Md 101)
    <br>
    Mendelevium is a short lived element created by Einstenium. With a half-life of only a few hours.
</p>
<p>Nobelium (No 102)
